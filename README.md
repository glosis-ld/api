# GLOSIS demo API
The Global Soil Information System (GLOSIS) demo API allows accessing GLOSIS-compliant
linked data represented according to the GLOSIS ontology, published under the permanent URL
[http://w3id.org/glosis/model](http://w3id.org/glosis/model), and which is publicly available
under its [GitHub repository] (https://github.com/rapw3k/glosis).
The demo API exposes methods to retrieve soil observations data stored and published as Linked Data
in a triplestore (by default FOODIE repository).
